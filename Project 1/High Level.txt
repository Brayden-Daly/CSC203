File Processor:
1. get line from line operations of user input from CLI
2. split at the operator to get the two numbers in operation
3. split the two numbers into each of their own arrays of ints (to use later to add one by one into linked lists for adding)

BigNumArithmetic:
1. get hashmap from file processor
2. use method from linkedlist class to create two linkedlists
3. reverse arrays in order to add easier
4. have add, mult, and exp methods to do operations on linked list numbers
5. print results

LinkedList:
1. construct linked list
2. append method

Node:
1. nodes used in linked list
